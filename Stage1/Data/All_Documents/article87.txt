Key bipartisan senators worked to secure an agreement Tuesday that could allow for several votes on gun-related amendments possibly next week, even as most of the proposals being discussed face long odds in Congress.
The emerging agreement came as students from a high school in Florida where 17 people were killed by a gunman lobbied lawmakers to find a legislative response to the attack.
"I think we can work this," said Sen. <n>Chris Murphy</n>, a Democrat from Connecticut who was seen in a lengthy discussion on the Senate floor Tuesday with Majority Whip <n>John Cornyn</n> of Texas. "I hope Sen. <n>McConnell</n> is willing to have a structure debate on the floor that will allow us to see where the votes fall on a number of gun violence measures ... ultimately <n>McConnell</n> and <n>Schumer</n> have to come to that agreement."
<n>Cornyn</n> also said that they were trying to find a way to bring legislation that would incentivize state and federal agencies to enter more information into the country's background check database -- known as "Fix NICs" -- to the floor.
"It requires consent," <n>Cornyn</n> said, noting that the debate likely wouldn't begin until after this week.
Earlier in the day, it appeared Republicans on Capitol Hill were steering the debate away from proposals to restrict gun purchases toward plans to beef up school security after the latest mass shooting at a Florida high school.
While a group of students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school made the rounds pressing top leaders from both parties to move legislation to ban assault-style weapons and high-capacity ammunition clips, expand background checks and raise the age for purchases of rifles, there is no appetite in either the GOP-controlled House or Senate to move any significant gun control bills.
"We had a considerable discussion about the school safety issue at lunch ... the view of the vast majority of my conference is that we should make progress on bills that we agree on," Senate Majority Leader <n>Mitch McConnell</n> told reporters at the Capitol
House Speaker <n>Paul Ryan</n> stressed his long held position on Tuesday morning that Congress shouldn't be "banning guns for law abiding citizens." He said the appropriate response in the wake of the tragedy was to look at why the system failed to pick up warnings on the shooter and to make sure those with mental health or other issues don't get access to weapons.
The number three House GOP leader echoed the need to drill down on what went wrong in the response from police on the ground.
