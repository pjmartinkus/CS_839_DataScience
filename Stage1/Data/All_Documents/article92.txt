The pizza chain, which last year blamed slumping sales on the NFL's handling of player protests, is ending its sponsorship of the league.
"While the NFL remains an important channel for us, we have determined that there are better ways to reach and activate this audience," CEO <n>Steve Ritchie</n> said a conference call to discuss the company's quarterly earnings. 
 Last fall, then-CEO <n>John Schnatter</n> received heavy criticism after he said Papa John's sales were hurt by the NFL's handling of protests by players who knelt during the National Anthem.
"This should have been nipped in the bud a year and a half ago," <n>Schnatter</n> told investors at the time. "The controversy is polarizing the customer, polarizing the country."
The company later apologized.
"The statements made on our earnings call were describing the factors that impact our business and we sincerely apologize to anyone that thought they were divisive," it said on Twitter. "That definitely was not our intention."
<n>Schnatter</n> left the company at the end of the year.
