It if seems like some new holiday gets celebrated every day, it's not just your imagination.
Name a day, and it's probably a holiday, though perhaps one you've never heard of: Poetry At Work Day (January 10). As Young As You Feel Day (March 22). International Beer Day (August 4).
As it turns out, anyone can create a holiday. And, as with most things, some people just seem to have a knack for it.
For some, it's how their brain is wired: They mark memories based on the calendar. Others figured out how to turn odd holiday ideas into income. Still others want to draw attention to a cause.
And thanks to them, everyday is a holiday.
The undisputed champ of holiday creation is <n>Adrienne Sioux Koopersmith</n>, a Chicago woman who bills herself as "America's Premier Eventologist." At last count, <n>Koopersmith</n> said she's created more than 1,900 holidays.
<n>Koopersmith</n> started creating holidays -- or "holidates," as she likes to call them -- about 30 years ago, almost as a form of therapy after she got mugged in the lobby of her apartment building by a robber who smashed her in the face with brass knuckles, she said.
"This was an event in and of itself that would change the entire course of my life," she told CNN.
In order to deal with the trauma of the attack, she started writing and creating cartoons, which she merged with her love of holidays.
