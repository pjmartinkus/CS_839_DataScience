<n>Esmond Allcock</n> has six children, 17 grandchildren, 36 great-grandchildren and 12 great-great-grandchildren.
But to his dismay, none of them were named for him.
That finally changed last year when his great-granddaughter <n>Jenna Lehne</n> decided to name her second son <n>Esmond</n>, prompting a tender moment when <n>Allcock</n> met his namesake for the first time.
"As he held my son, he kissed his head and said over and over again, 'You don't know what this means to me. You don't know what this means to me,'" <n>Lehne</n> wrote in a post published last week on Love What Matters, a site that celebrates real-life stories of love and compassion.
At 108, <n>Allcock</n> is one of Canada's oldest residents. The widower lives in an assisted-living facility in Kerrobert, Saskatchewan.
"When I got pregnant with my second, he mentioned to my grandmother that he was responsible for 71 descendants and no one had named their son after him," <n>Lehne</n> wrote in her post. "My husband and I had wanted to name our new son after family, and that just sealed the deal." 
<n>Lehne</n> and her family live about five hours away in Okotoks, Alberta.
When little <n>Esmond</n> was born on January 11, 2017 -- nearly 107 years after his great-great-grandfather -- Canada's bitter winter weather made a visit difficult. But once the snow started to melt last spring, <n>Lehne</n> decided to travel to Kerrobert to surprise <n>Allcock</n> and introduce him to his namesake.
"He takes such joy in his family and his decedents. He's met all of his great-great-grand-kids and he loves each and every one of them," she told CNN.
