Students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School return to class this week, as the gun debate ignited by the mass shooting there rages on. More than a dozen businesses backed away from the NRA over its response to the shooting. President <n>Trump</n> who says he'll support stricter background checks and age requirements for gun purchases -- plans to talk to the nation's governors about it today when they get together at the White House. There's growing pressure on Broward County Sheriff <n>Scott Israel</n> to resign after several of his deputies failed to engage shooter <n>Nikolas Cruz</n> during the massacre. And everyone is dumbfounded at the stunning number of red flags about <n>Cruz</n> that were missed.
The bombing of Eastern Ghouta continues despite a new UN ceasefire OK'd over the weekend. Doctors in the besieged Damascus suburb say the ceasefire is just "ink on paper" that's done nothing to stop the barbaric deaths being inflicted upon the people there. And the violence is about to get worse, as there are now reports of ground attacks on Eastern Ghouta, one of the last rebel strongholds in the country. The Syrian regime claims it's targeting terrorists and will continue to do so despite the ceasefire.
The Democrats' (redacted) memo on alleged FBI abuses is finally out. (You can read it in full here). It tries to undercut the previously released GOP memo on two main points. First, it says the FBI did let a court know of the Democratic ties to the infamous <n>Trump</n> dossier when the agency used it in asking for a warrant to conduct surveillance on <n>Trump</n> associate <n>Carter Page</n>. Second, the memo argues the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election didn't start with the dossier; it had already been going on for weeks. President <n>Trump</n> dismissed the Dems' memo as a "politically driven document."
