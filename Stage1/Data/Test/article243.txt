Mr. <n>Trump</n> in these comments was repeating a stereotype that is popular and also false: that "insane" people are to blame for gun violence. The notion that violence can be blamed on those with psychiatric disabilities stands in stark contrast to the reality of what life is like for such people in this country, as the <n>Deborah Danner</n> story makes all too clear. <n>Trump</n> invokes fear through stereotype in an effort to distract from the obvious reason he and many others of his party fail to take seriously gun violence and the threat it poses to all Americans, including our schoolchildren: the millions in financial support those politicians receive from the gun lobbies.
The NRA likewise opts to scapegoat some "insane" bogeyman during times like these. During last Wednesday night's CNN town hall with survivors in Florida, NRA spokeswoman <n>Dana Loesch</n> was asked by student activist <n>Emma Gonzalez</n> whether it should be harder to obtain fully automatic weapons. <n>Loesch</n> in her answer spoke about an "insane monster," "crazy people," and repeatedly used the words "crazy" and "nuts."
The mainstream media have largely failed to condemn the flagrant ableism of such statements by members of the GOP and the NRA. Even our most liberal outlets continue to repeat lies or misinformation about "the mentally ill" and violence. Research has shown that people with psychiatric disabilities are no more likely to be violent.
People with psychiatric diagnoses are ten times as likely to be the victims of violent crime, according to statistics backed by the federal government. They are likelier to harm themselves. They are likelier to be injured -- and killed -- by police.
