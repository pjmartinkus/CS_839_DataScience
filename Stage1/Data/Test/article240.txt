<n>Trump</n> can be forgiven his age, and his physical condition and, given the psychology of old men, he might even be forgiven if he privately mused about what he would have done at Parkland. But his public bragging in the face of tragedy amounts to an unforgivable display of insensitivity. He insulted those who train and maintain themselves to respond in such crises, and once again degraded the public discourse with the kind of babbling more suited to a corner tavern.
Previous presidents, even those who might have had reason to declare themselves ready for dangerous duty, would never have done it. That <n>Trump</n> would brag in this way only affirms that he is unfit, in every way.
