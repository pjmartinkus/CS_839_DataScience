Schools in West Virginia are closed for a fourth day Tuesday as nearly 20,000 teachers and about 13,000 school service personnel participate in a work stoppage.
They're engaged in a battle with the state government for better benefits and higher wages.
Governor <n>Jim Justice</n> has maintained that the state's budget simply cannot handle the financial burden of a further pay raise for personnel -- he approved a 4% raise over three years last week -- or immediate changes to the public employees' insurance program.
Teachers, support staff and other supporters rallied at Charleston's state capitol building Monday, marching inside the building, waving signs at passing cars, and chanting on the steps.
"I'm a fourth-grade teacher in Mercer County. ... I also have a second teaching job that I teach online to Chinese children. I teach them how to speak English. ... We have two little boys at home, and the whole insurance prices raising is going to be a real issue for us, for our family. And really, sometimes the only way we can make ends meet is through my second teaching job and through other little side jobs that I do."
