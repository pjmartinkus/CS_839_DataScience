The 2018 Winter Olympic Games mixed sport and politics in equal measure.
As well as politicians and Olympic organizers having to navigate the complex relationship between North and South Korea, the issue of Russian doping overshadowed PyeongChang 2018.
One hundred and sixty eight Russian athletes competed for the Olympic Athlete from Russia (OAR) team under a neutral flag, provided they could prove there were clean.
CNN Sport has been in Pyeongchang, South Korea, covering the Games and below are our top 11 moments.
At PyeongChang 2018, a worldwide star was born. The reaction to <n>Chloe Kim</n> becoming the youngest snowboarder to win Olympic gold was on a level which only the likes of <n>Usain Bolt</n> experience.
The 17-year-old ran the gauntlet of TV interviews and negotiated the maze of reporters with equanimity. But hers is a life changed. According to reports, her limited-edition "Gold Medal" Kellogg's Corn Flakes box sold out in seven hours, a record said the company.
Even before she won gold -- and became the first female to land consecutive 1080s in the halfpipe at the Olympics -- she could already count Nike, Toyota and Mondelez as her sponsors. More blue chip companies will surely follow. 
It was a tender moment between two men in love, an openly gay Olympian kissing his boyfriend at the bottom of the hill during the ski slopestyle event.
Broadcast live to the world and then shared on social media, <n>Gus Kenworthy</n>'s kiss with boyfriend <n>Matthew Wilkas</n> was hailed as a celebration of LGBTQ pride. It was another notable occasion at a Winter Olympics which has been full of symbolism.
Four years ago, <n>Kenworthy</n> had wanted to share a kiss with his then boyfriend at the Sochi Winter Olympics. But having yet to reveal he was gay, the slopestyle silver medalist had second thoughts. He was not ready for that to be his coming-out moment.
But in Pyeongchang, despite not winning a medal, he told CNN: "This was actually the Olympic experience I was hoping for. I'm leaving here more fulfilled without a medal than I did at the last games with one."
