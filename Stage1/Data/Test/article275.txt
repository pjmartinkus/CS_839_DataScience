The oligarch whose company is linked to the Russian mercenary group believed to be behind an attack on US and allied forces in Syria earlier this month is alleged to have made a systematic effort to silence reports of his activities, CNN has learned.
Russians who have come into the orbit of <n>Yevgeny Prigozhin</n> -- the man dubbed â€œ<n>Putin</n>'s chef" by the local press -- have told CNN of being pursued on social media and confronted in person after making critical comments or asking probing questions.
<n>Prigozhin</n> has been at the center of the confrontation between Washington and Moscow. He was indicted last week by the US special counsel, and the US claims his business empire has effectively become an arm of Russian foreign policy. US investigators believe he financed a Russian "troll factory" that spread fake news during the 2016 US presidential campaign. He is also believed to be linked to <n>Wagner</n>, a mercenary firm involved in a deadly encounter with US forces and their allies in Syria on February 7. His company has denied allegations of a link to Wagner.
