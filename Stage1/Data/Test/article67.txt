President <n>Donald Trump</n> is pushing to have his longtime personal pilot, <n>John Dunkin</n>, to head the Federal Aviation Administration, according to a report from Axios.
<n>Dunkin</n>, who flew <n>Trump</n>'s personal plane during the campaign, is reportedly on the short list for the top spot at the agency that oversees civil aviation in the United States. <n>Dunkin</n> has previously told people that he would often face delays while flying <n>Trump</n> around and that a pilot running the agency would prevent that.
Administration officials have been pushing back against industry critics of the potential appointment.
"<n>John Dunkin</n> isn't just a pilot," an administration official told Axios. "He's managed airline and corporate flight departments, certified airlines from start-up under FAA regulations, and oversaw the <n>Trump</n> presidential campaign's air fleet, which included managing all aviation transportation for travel to 203 cities in 43 states over the course of 21 months."
<n>Dunkin</n> has been interviewed for the post, with one source saying he was "impressive."
Other potential candidates for the job include Republican Rep. <n>Sam Graves</n> of Missouri and current acting FAA Administrator <n>Dan Elwell</n>. He took over for <n>Michael Huerta</n>, an <n>Obama</n> appointee, whose term expired in January.
