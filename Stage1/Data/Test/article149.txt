President <n>Donald Trump</n> had immigration on his mind Wednesday morning, firing off a collection of tweets praising his administration's efforts.
<n>Trump</n> started by hailing a court ruling on Tuesday that allowed his border wall to proceed, but seemed to acknowledge that no actual construction on any new border barriers can begin until Congress authorizes funds.
"I have decided that sections of the Wall that California wants built NOW will not be built until the whole Wall is approved. Big victory yesterday with ruling from the courts that allows us to proceed. OUR COUNTRY MUST HAVE BORDER SECURITY!" <n>Trump</n> tweeted.
<n>Trump</n> did not mention that he had previously attacked the judge, <n>Golanzo Curiel</n>, when he presided over a lawsuit against <n>Trump</n> University. <n>Trump</n> said in 2016 that <n>Curiel</n>, who was born in Indiana, was biased against him due to his Mexican heritage.
