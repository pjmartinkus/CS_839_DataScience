President <n>Donald Trump</n> says a military parade in Washington could take place on Veterans Day or the Fourth of July, adding that it would be "something great for the spirit of the country."
"The generals would love to do it, I tell you, and so would I," <n>Trump</n> told Fox News' <n>Jeanine Pirro</n> on Saturday night, pitching it as "a great representative parade. We'd have a lot of plane flyovers."
The President acknowledged, however, that the production would have to come at a "reasonable cost" and said the government is still in preliminary talks about the idea.
<n>Trump</n> also said he was inspired by the Bastille Day parade in France, noting that "it was quite something."
"It's just preliminarily being discussed," <n>Trump</n> said. "But we're talking about probably Veterans Day. I like July 4th because July 4th in Washington, DC, would be beautiful. It would be up and down Pennsylvania Avenue."
"We'll see if we can do it at a reasonable cost, and if we can't, we won't do it. But the generals would love to do it, I can tell you, and so would I," the President continued. "I think it's great for our country in terms of being a cheerleader and the spirit."
Earlier this month, a Pentagon spokesman confirmed that <n>Trump</n> asked for a military parade, and the Pentagon is reviewing potential dates.
