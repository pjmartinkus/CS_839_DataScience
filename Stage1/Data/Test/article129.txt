A north Georgia high school teacher was arrested on Wednesday after he barricaded himself in a classroom and fired a shot from his handgun out of a window, police said.
No one was injured in the incident at Dalton High School, except for a student who injured an ankle running through the school, police spokesman <n>Bruce Frazier</n> said.
The shooting about 85 miles north of Atlanta heightened the already tense debate around guns in schools in the wake of the deadly mass shooting in Parkland, Florida two weeks ago.
President <n>Donald Trump</n> and the National Rifle Association, among others, have proposed that teachers should be allowed to bring firearms into schools to defend against possible attacks. But critics have said arming teachers would create a host of other dangerous side effects -- and pointed to the <n>Dalton</n> shooting as Exhibit A in that argument. 
The incident began about 11:30 a.m. when <n>Randal Davidson</n>, a 53-year-old social studies teacher, refused to let students into his classroom, <n>Frazier</n> said. When the principal put a key in the door in an attempt to enter, <n>Davidson</n> fired a shot from a handgun through an exterior window of the classroom, according to <n>Frazier</n>.
The school immediately went into lockdown, and police quickly arrived and evacuated the immediate area around his classroom. After about 30 to 45 minutes, <n>Davidson</n> agreed to surrender to authorities and was taken into custody without further incident, <n>Frazier</n> said.
