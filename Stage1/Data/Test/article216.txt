<n>Trump</n> has employed this tactic on his own repeatedly during his time in office. Some times it is done openly and shamelessly; other times, it plays like background music coloring what seems like more high-minded debate.
When facing a political crush, like after the GOP failed last summer to repeal Obamacare, he took the former approach -- oxygenating his base with a flurry of culture war offensives. In August, he refused to unconditionally condemn white nationalists and neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, eventually becoming fixated on the preservation of "beautiful statues and monuments" to Confederate military commanders. A little more than a month later, he began his crusade against protesting NFL players, exploiting the demonstrations to dig an even deeper divide between red and blue America.
In <n>Loesch</n>'s NRA video, she concludes that "the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth." What that has to do with responsible gun ownership is anyone's guess. But the message is unmistakeable. It echoes <n>Trump</n>'s campaign slogan, which he now often uses to punctuate a partisan tweet -- the promise to "Make America Great Again!"
By this weird trumpian transitive property, supporting the President becomes a precondition for attaining a certain brand of righteous patriotism -- or, in the case of Charlottesville, cover for something sinister that even a few years ago lurked anxiously in the shadows, well outside the boundaries of the mainstream.
