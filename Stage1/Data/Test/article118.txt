"USA Today's Opposing View shows readers more than one point of view on an issue," a USA Today spokesperson told CNN in a statement. "Our signature debate format reinforces our reputation for fairness, which is one of our core values. Today's Opposing View issue and author have caused much debate and feedback. The Opposing View on arming teachers has been updated with more information about author <n>Jerome R. Corsi</n>."
While <n>Corsi</n>'s piece -- which argued that qualified teachers and school staff should be armed so that would-be school shooters "can be neutralized before schoolchildren are senselessly murdered" -- was relatively tame commentary that falls in line with the thinking of many Republicans, it was surprising the third largest US newspaper by circulation would lend its platform to someone as radical as him. A survey touted by USA Today on its website place its daily readership at more than three million.
Despite being one of the world's leading conspiracy theorists, <n>Corsi</n>, who could not be reached for comment, was initially only described by USA Today as an author and "investigative journalist." His connection to InfoWars was omitted from the newspaper's print version of the column, and only after inquiries from media outlets was the online version of the story updated to say that he heads the DC bureau for the fringe website.
USA Today, however, didn't explain what InfoWars exactly is to its readers. <n>Bill Sternberg</n>, the newspaper's editorial page editor, told CNN, "The space available for taglines does not permit full biographies; readers who want to know more can do simple Google searches."
