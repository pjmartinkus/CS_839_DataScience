The second-ranking Senate Republican broke with President <n>Donald Trump</n> on Friday when he told CNN that the President's proposal to raise the legal age to buy a rifle to 21 may not "save lives" and doesn't get at the "root of the problem."
Sen. <n>John Cornyn</n> of Texas also said that the idea, which <n>Trump</n> unexpectedly embraced this week, may not have enough GOP support to pass the Senate.
<n>Cornyn</n> said Washington -- which is searching for a legislative response to the massacre last week at a high school in Florida -- should instead focus on passing his more narrow bill, known as "Fix NICS," that would shore up reporting compliance to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.
<n>Cornyn</n> oversees counting and whipping votes for the GOP leadership. He said he thought other Republicans would share his concerns making it uncertain if <n>Trump</n>'s proposal could get the 60 votes it would need to pass the Senate.
