Twenty years ago, <n>Monica Lewinsky</n> became a household name -- for all the wrong reasons.
In a new essay for Vanity Fair reflecting on her relationship with then-President <n>Bill Clinton</n> and everything that followed from it <n>Lewinsky</n> wrote these two striking paragraphs:
"Just four years ago, in an essay for this magazine, I wrote the following: "Sure, my boss took advantage of me, but I will always remain firm on this point: it was a consensual relationship. Any 'abuse' came in the aftermath, when I was made a scapegoat in order to protect his powerful position." I now see how problematic it was that the two of us even got to a place where there was a question of consent. Instead, the road that led there was littered with inappropriate abuse of authority, station, and privilege. (Full stop.)
"Now, at 44, I'm beginning (just beginning) to consider the implications of the power differentials that were so vast between a president and a White House intern. I'm beginning to entertain the notion that in such a circumstance the idea of consent might well be rendered moot. (Although power imbalances—and the ability to abuse them—do exist even when the sex has been consensual.)"
<n>Lewinsky</n>'s willingness to re-examine her conclusions about what her relationship with the president meant -- particularly amid the ongoing #metoo movement -- should occasion a broader conversation in American politics about <n>Clinton</n> and how his affair with <n>Lewinsky</n> is viewed by all of us.
In her essay, <n>Lewinsky</n> rightly notes that 1998 was, in retrospect, a turning point -- and not in a good way -- for American politics. Smartly, <n>Lewinsky</n> writes:
"Both clinically and observationally, something fundamental changed in our society in 1998, and it is changing again as we enter the second year of the <n>Trump</n> presidency in a post-Whoever-Is-Next world. The <n>Starr</n> investigation and the subsequent impeachment trial of <n>Bill Clinton</n> amounted to a crisis that Americans arguably endured collectively—some of us, obviously, more than others. It was a shambolic morass of a scandal that dragged on for 13 months, and many politicians and citizens became collateral damage—along with the nation's capacity for mercy, measure, and perspective."
