He didn't. Instead, <n>Sessions</n> said this: "As long as I am the attorney general, I will continue to discharge my duties with integrity and honor, and this department will continue to do its work in a fair and impartial manner according to the law and Constitution."
This isn't about Sessions, though. Not really. This is about <n>Trump</n> redefining -- downward -- the sort of behavior we are willing to accept (or ignore) from our leaders.
The President touts himself as the biggest, baddest boss in town. If that's true, and if he really believes Sessions is doing as poor a job as he seems to believe, via his tweets, then <n>Trump</n> should fire the attorney general. If not, he should let <n>Sessions</n> do his job without undermining him at every turn.
That is what an adult does. What <n>Trump</n> is doing is the opposite.
And yet, with the exception of a handful of Republicans who have come to <n>Sessions</n> defense, there has been little hue and cry over this latest attack from Trump.
Maybe that's because there's an ongoing feud between his chief of staff and his son-in-law. Or maybe it's because his communications director had admitted to telling white lies in support of him. Or maybe it's because the special counsel <n>Robert Mueller</n> is looking into <n>Trump</n>'s financial status -- and maneuvers -- prior to his decision to run for president.
I get it. <n>Trump</n> has a remarkable knack for making news. But when his attacks on Sessions aren't big news anymore, it amounts to a tacit acceptance that that sort of behavior is normal now. It isn't. Or it shouldn't be.
