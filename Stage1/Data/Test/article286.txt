<n>Manafort</n> has, to date, denied any and all charges against him -- including the allegations Thursday that he and <n>Gates</n> laundered more than $30 million and didn't pay taxes on it for a decade.
"The new allegations against Mr. <n>Manafort</n>, once again, have nothing to do with Russia and 2016 election interference/collusion," said <n>Manafort</n>'s spokesman on Thursday. "Mr. <n>Manafort</n> is confident that he will be acquitted and violations of his constitutional rights will be remedied."
Given <n>Gates</n>' long-working relationship with <n>Manafort</n> -- the former has been the latter's wingman in private business and on the <n>Trump</n> campaign for the better part of the last 10 years -- it's possible that <n>Mueller</n> sees <n>Gates</n> as having the goods to convict <n>Manafort</n> on the charges against him.
