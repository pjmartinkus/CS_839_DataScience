That black-and-white outlook served <n>Mueller</n> well at the Department of Justice, where he oversaw some of the highest-profile cases of the last few decades including the prosecution of mobster <n>John Gotti</n> and Panamanian Dictator <n>Manuel Noriega</n>. But it was his investigation into the 1988 terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland that would most profoundly affect him.
"It was a very personal and a pivotal investigation of his career," according to <n>Lisa Monaco</n>, who served as <n>Mueller</n>'s chief of staff when he was FBI director. "It is something that has stuck with him, and I think it was because he was so affected by walking the ground in <n>Lockerbie</n> after that plane went down, seeing the remnants of that plane, seeing the piecing together of the plane and the Christmas presents the passengers on that plane were carrying home to their family members, and seeing that all literally get pieced together in a warehouse in Scotland at the beginning of the investigation."
