At least 5,300 UK retail jobs are at risk after Toys "R" Us and electronics chain Maplin collapsed on Wednesday. They folded because of online competition and Brexit-fueled economic pain.
In total, Britain has lost 65,000 retail jobs since it voted to leave the European Union, according to the most recent data from the Office for National Statistics. 
Here's what's bringing retailers to their knees:
PwC, which is in charge of winding down Maplin, said the chain had been hit hard by weaker consumer spending and more expensive imports.
Higher import costs can be traced to the EU referendum in June, 2016.
The British pound dropped dramatically following the vote, making it more expensive for retailers to purchase goods from abroad. That has translated into high prices for consumers.
Inflation, which began last year at 1.8%, now stands at 3% -- well above average wage growth.
