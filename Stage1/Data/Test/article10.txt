"Clueless" star and former Fox commentator <n>Stacey Dash</n> is running for Congress in California.
The actress and outspoken Republican filed paperwork Monday to run in California's 44th district, which is currently represented by Democrat <n>Nanette Barrag√°n</n>.
The district, which includes Compton, Watts, San Pedro and North Long Beach, has long been represented by a Democrat. It overwhelmingly voted for Democratic presidential nominee <n>Hillary Clinton</n> in 2016, 83%-12%.
Representatives for <n>Dash</n> did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. <n>Dash</n> has not publicly issued a statement. However, she did tease a potential run earlier this month.
"A number of people online and off have suggested I run for political office," she tweeted February 9. "I wanted to see what my online community thinks of this idea as I mull the possibilities. Thoughts?" She attached a graphic of a campaign button, which is red, white and blue and decorated with stars. It reads: "<n>Dash</n> to D.C."
