Congress is in recess until next week. <n>Cornyn</n>, who was in the Capitol on Friday to preside over a brief pro forma session, said he thought an age restriction would be problematic if an 18-year-old Marine or police officer were told he or she could not buy a gun.
"I can see that it would be difficult to enforce," he said. "I'm not sure why we would go to those lengths when I don't think that gets to the root of the problem."
Republicans hold a 51-49 advantage. It's likely many Democrats would support raising the limit, but it's a relatively new discussion point, so it's not clear where they all stand.
<n>Cornyn</n> was asked if <n>Trump</n> is getting ahead of most Hill Republicans on gun control and whether he is concerned <n>Trump</n> is driven by an emotional response to the mass killing and the dramatic listening session he held with survivors this week at the White House.
