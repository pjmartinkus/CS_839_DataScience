For more than 15 years, Utah educators have been able to bring their guns to schools. The state's concealed weapons law allows any person with a permit to have a weapon inside a school.
School officials have said that only a small fraction do it, but they can't tell with certainty.
If the teachers do have a loaded gun, their principals, school districts, and local police departments wouldn't even know because given they don't have to report it and they can't asked them, according to a state law.
In recent years, no fatal incidents involving teachers with guns in schools have been reported, but in 2014 an elementary school teacher discharged her concealed firearm when she went into the faculty restroom of a Taylorsville, Utah school, CNN affiliate KSL reported.
The teacher removed her handgun and when she attempted to holster it, the gun went off, striking the toilet.
She was charged with a misdemeanor charge of discharging a firearm in city limits. She pleaded no contest and was ordered to take a firearms safety course in order to get the case dismissed.
