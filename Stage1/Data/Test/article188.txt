President <n>Donald Trump</n> has hired <n>Brad Parscale</n>, the digital media director of his 2016 campaign, to run his re-election bid, the campaign announced on Tuesday.
The announcement was initially hyped by The Drudge Report, a website run by <n>Matt Drudge</n>, a conservative figure with considerable influence inside the White House. But it was no surprise that <n>Trump</n> will run for re-election in 2020 -- he filed shortly after his 2017 inauguration -- but it is unusual for a sitting president to hire a campaign manager three years before the election.
White House press secretary <n>Sarah Sanders</n> told reporters in June 2017 that <n>Trump</n> was going to run for re-election in 2020.
"Of course, he's running for re-election," <n>Sanders</n> said.
<n>Eric Trump</n>, one of the President's sons, touted <n>Parscale</n> as an "amazing talent" who was "pivotal to our success in 2016."
"He has our family's complete trust and is the perfect person to be at the helm of the campaign," he said in a release from the campaign.
<n>Jared Kushner</n>, the President's son-in-law and senior adviser, added that <n>Parscale</n> was "essential in bringing a disciplined technology and data-driven approach to how the 2016 campaign."
The campaign also said in the announcement that it would be involved in the 2018 midterm election by "providing candidates with general support, endorsements and rallying the support of the political grassroots by engaging <n>Trump</n> supporters in districts and states."
