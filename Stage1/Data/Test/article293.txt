A week before the primary in the Arizona House special election, a leading Republican candidate's campaign is being roiled by an alleged cyber-affair with a former state Senate staffer.
Former state Sen. <n>Steve Montenegro</n>, who is running to fill former US Rep. <n>Trent Franks</n> vacant seat, and the Senate GOP's former digital media coordinator, <n>Stephanie Holford</n>, exchanged flirtatious text messages last year, the Arizona Republic reported.
<n>Holford</n> also sent Montenegro -- a married minister who bills himself as a "leader of virtue" -- a topless photo. Both <n>Holford</n>, through her attorney, and <n>Montenegro</n> in an interview confirmed that the photo was sent.
