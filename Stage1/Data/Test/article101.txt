SeaWorld Entertainment (SEAS)appointed company insider <n>John Reilly</n> to serve as interim CEO after <n>Joel Manby</n> resigned.
The company said Tuesday that <n>Manby</n> "agreed that this is the right time to identify a new CEO as the company enters its next phase of intensified focus on execution and growth. 
SeaWorld said that it lost about $200 million in fiscal year 2017, which was not quite as bad as the year before, when it lost $215 million. Revenue was $1.26 billion, down from $1.34 billion the year before.
Attendance at its theme parks, a key measure of SeaWorld's financial health, was down again in 2017. SeaWorld said that 20.8 million guests visited its parks last year, compared with 22 million the year before.
The company said it's hoping to attract guests with 15 new rides and new marketing strategies, and is cutting $65 million in costs. The company laid off 350 workers last year.
SeaWorld has been struggling with its image ever since the CNN documentary "Blackfish" came out in 2013. The film focused on an orca that had killed people, including a trainer, and suggested that the conditions in which it was confined at SeaWorld contributed to its violent behavior. The company has disputed certain points in the documentary.
The animal rights organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA, has been an outspoken opponent of SeaWorld and any other company that uses animals in entertainment, like Ringling Brothers Circus, which shut down last year after nearly 150 years in business.
