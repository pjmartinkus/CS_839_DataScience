<n>Ojeda</n> was in the third rescue group to reach the high school after shooter <n>Nikolas Cruz</n> had opened fire on students, teachers and staff that day. He said it was a scene of "organized chaos."
When <n>Wilford</n> was brought to them, she was so pale they didn't think she was alive, until another officer shook her.
"I believe she gasped, or she moved," <n>Ojeda</n> said. "She made signs of life."
Alive, but in bad shape. She had a number of injuries, including a chest wound, which <n>Ojeda</n> says a SWAT team member from the Broward County Sheriff's Office sealed up, an act which also contributed to her survival.
<n>Ojeda</n> and his team prepared her for transport.
"I looked at Maddy, and she didn't look 15," <n>Ojeda</n> said. "We had been told to take her to (Broward Health Medical Center)."
That medical facility, which also has a children's hospital on its campus, was about 30 miles away, and <n>Ojeda</n> was worried Wilford would die before they got there.
