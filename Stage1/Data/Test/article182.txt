On Tuesday, <n>Rogers</n> reiterated that he still views Moscow as a threat to the 2018 elections, a stance that is consistent with what he and other top national security officials told the Senate Intelligence Committee earlier this month.
"We expect Russia to continue using propaganda, social media, false-flag personas, sympathetic spokesmen and other means to influence, to try to build on its wide range of operations and exacerbate social and political fissures in the United States," Director of National Intelligence <n>Dan Coats</n> previously testified.
"There should be no doubt that Russia perceives its past efforts as successful and views the 2018 US midterm elections as a potential target for Russian influence operations," he said.
But that conclusion appears at odds with <n>Trump</n>'s repeated dismissals of Russian election meddling.
<n>Trump</n> declared last week that "the facts" prove he's been tougher on Russia than his predecessor, President <n>Barack Obama</n> but it is clear that is not the case -- especially when it comes to punishing Russia for interfering in US elections.
<n>Trump</n> has yet to levy a single sanction to punish Russia for election interference, despite the fact that Congress almost unanimously passed legislation that took effect on January 29 requiring him to do so, and despite senior intelligence officials testifying that Russia is trying to disrupt the 2018 midterms.
<n>Rogers</n> clearly indicated on Tuesday that the US response to Moscow's interference in the 2016 election has been insufficient and has done little to deter ongoing attacks.
