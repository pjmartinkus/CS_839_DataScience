I have a vivid memory of first hearing <n>Billy Graham</n>'s name. It was the mid-1980s and AIDS was slowly becoming part of the national conversation. AIDS was considered a plague and those afflicted were largely ignored or feared by their churches and the government. I saw people who were whispered to have the virus, and then saw that after a few months they quietly disappeared.
There were many Republicans and Democrats who were vehemently anti-gay (although the Democratic party had begun an active outreach to "homosexual" voters). President <n>Ronald Reagan</n> didn't utter the term "AIDS" until 1987. 
It was an era in which televangelism had risen to become a national phenomenon, and I was close friends with a guy from a Christian family that was obsessed with 80s TV preachers <n>Jim Bakker</n>, <n>Jimmy Swaggart</n> and, of course, the more venerable <n>Billy Graham</n>. When I visited my friend's house, his parents kept the dramatic preachers in heavy rotation.
"Homosexuality" was a constant topic with these millionaire hypocrites (<n>Bakker</n> and <n>Swaggart</n> were both toppled from their pulpits in shameful, fiery glory with epic sex scandals -- and <n>Bakker</n> did time for fraud too). However, there was one person who was not preaching against the LGBT community and AIDS: <n>Tammy Faye Bakker</n>, the former evangelical co-host and wife of <n>Jim Bakker</n>.
In 1985, <n>Tammy</n> interviewed <n>Steve Pieters</n>, who was living with AIDS. My friend's parents were watching the interview and were horrified that <n>Tammy</n> appeared to accept that <n>Pieters</n> was born gay. In a now iconic moment, she begged for compassion for people living with AIDS.
