The organization has for decades now hooked its narrow interests in with broader ones. On May 20, 2000, not long after <n>George W. Bush</n> became the GOP's presumptive presidential nominee and Republicans began to gear up for a campaign fight with Vice President <n>Al Gore</n>, the NRA's top lobbyist, <n>Jim Baker</n>, delivered his own bitter warning to the rank-and-file.
"For the next six months, <n>Al Gore</n> is going to smear you as the enemy," he said at the group's annual meeting. "He will slander you as gun-toting, knuckle-dragging, bloodthirsty maniacs who stand in the way of a safer America. Will you remain silent? I will not remain silent. If we are going to stop this, then it is vital to every law-abiding gun owner in American to register to vote and show up at the polls on Election Day."
By today's standards, <n>Baker</n>'s riff seems tame. He directs his harshest language at <n>Gore</n>, the candidate, not (directly) at Democrats more widely. But the principle is the same. Gun rights are almost incidental to the argument, which says that the other side despises you and looks down on you. And that you, the "law-abiding gun owner," would be fooling yourself -- capitulating to a liberal leviathan -- by considering any kind of negotiation or compromise.
This past weekend, at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland, just outside of Washington, DC, <n>Loesch</n> delivered one of the early talks. She was fresh off a nationally televised, unusually milquetoast appearance at a CNN town hall on gun control and so, back among unquestioning allies, returned to the script.
