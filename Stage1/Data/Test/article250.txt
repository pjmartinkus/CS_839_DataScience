May gathered key members of her fractious Cabinet this week for an "away day" at her country retreat, Chequers, in a bid to galvanize support within her divided party for a common position on Brexit.
She needs to establish Britain's terms for the transition period that will follow its departure from the EU in March 2019. However, that process has been fraught with difficulty in the past few months.
UK media reports indicate that Cabinet ministers agreed Thursday on an approach of "managed divergence" by which Britain would take control of its own regulations but maintain the standards required by the EU in certain key areas to protect trade and jobs.
"The Brexit committee made a step forward yesterday by agreeing (to) the basics of the future relationship," a Downing Street representative told CNN.
Chancellor of the Exchequer <n>Philip Hammond</n> tweeted Friday that the Chequers meeting had been "positive and constructive" and that "steady progress" was being made toward delivering Brexit.
Speaking Tuesday in Vienna, Austria, <n>David Davis</n>, secretary of state for exiting the EU, described what Britain aspired to as "a race to the top in global standards," which meant that British regulators and institutions could continue to be recognized by the EU.
"We start from a position of total alignment, with unprecedented experience in working with one another's regulators and institutions," <n>Davis</n> said.
