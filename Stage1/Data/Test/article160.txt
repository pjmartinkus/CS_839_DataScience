Even by President <n>Donald Trump</n>'s frenetic standards, the events of the last 48 hours have been insane.
Major resignations! Infighting! <n>Robert Mueller</n>! And much, much more.
Because no one could keep track of it all, we -- me and the one and only <n>Brenna Williams</n> -- made a list. Here it is:
White House communications director <n>Hope Hicks</n> resigned.
<n>John Kelly</n> and <n>Jared Kushner</n> and <n>Ivanka Trump</n> are fighting.
Special counsel <n>Robert Mueller</n> is looking into <n>Donald Trump</n>'s financial maneuvers prior to his announcing for president.
