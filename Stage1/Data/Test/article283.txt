The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission was awarded a handmade rifle by the National Rifle Association Friday at the Conservative Political Action Conference.
<n>Ajit Pai</n>, the FCC's chairman who oversaw the highly controversial repeal of the commission's net neutrality rules last year, was awarded the rifle, along with the NRA's "Charlton Heston Courage Under Fire Award," for his efforts last year during the repeal.
The award came as a surprise to <n>Pai</n>, who was expecting to give a speech unrelated to the NRA. The rifle is awarded "when someone has stood up under pressure with grace and dignity and principled discipline," said <n>Carolyn Meadows</n>, the second vice-president of the NRA.
<n>Meadows</n> added that she was unable to bring the gun onstage, due to CPAC's rules regarding weapons.
