<n>Garba Tela<n/>'s wife did not want him to send their daughter to school in Dapchi. She feared Zainab would be an easy target for insurgents.
"They take girls there," she told him.
Her prediction has proved accurate. Their 14-year-old daughter is one of 110 schoolgirls feared kidnapped by suspected Boko Haram militants in a raid on their school last Monday.
<n>Tela</n>, who lives in Dapchi, now says his other children are refusing to go to school after last week's attack.
"The situation we are in now, we don't know what to do. Her sisters say they won't go to school again," he said.
"My wife had told me before that it was not good to take her to a girls school, that they take girls there. And this now happened.
"I have tried to pet (cajole) them now. What can I do? I leave everything to Allah," said <n>Tela</n>, who works as a tailor.
"We're village people, we don't have the power to chase the people who take our girls," he added. "Government should just help us get our daughter."
