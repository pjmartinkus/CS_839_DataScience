There is still work to be done in the state Legislature, but West Virginia schoolteachers will be back at work Thursday after a four-day walkout over pay and benefits.
The question is how long they will stay in their classrooms.
On Tuesday, Gov. <n>Jim Justice</n> announced teachers and other education-related employees would be getting a 5% pay raise in the first year as long as lawmakers approve it in a new bill.
<n>Justice</n>, who said he changed his position on raises after talking to a sixth-grader, told reporters he has spoken to the leaders of the Senate and the House and he was "very, very hopeful" a bill would pass soon replacing one that included a smaller raise over more time.
But the issue of insurance will take time and a task force, the governor said, and teachers weren't happy -- at least those assembled at the state Capitol -- that there was no immediate fix.
The educators who had come to Charleston gave big cheers when told of the potential pay raise, but there were many boos when they learned insurance issues were to be dealt with later.
After they were told they would go back to schools Thursday with a possibility they might get called to strike again, teachers chanted "Back to the table!" and "Fix it now!"
Turning one dollar into eight is a good investment, the governor told Gideon.
"Wouldn't it be an investment to invest in smart teachers that would make me smart and then I can in turn, turn around and do smart, good things for our state?" the student replied.
The governor said <n>Gideon</n> was right and he was approaching the strike wrong.
"I was looking at it as what the prudent thing was to do and not as investment." he said Tuesday.
The strike put about 20,000 teachers and 13,000 school service employees on the picket lines.
<n>Dale Lee</n>, president of the West Virginia Education Association, said the organization reserves the right to call teachers and service workers out again at a later date if the legislation gets bogged down or doesn't move ahead at their desired speed.
