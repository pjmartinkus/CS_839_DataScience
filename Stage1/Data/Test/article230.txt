<n>Joelle Guarino</n> says she knew <n>Nikolas Cruz</n> was going to shoot up a school. She just didn't know when.
"I had no doubt he was going to do this," <n>Guarino</n> told CNN. "My husband and I both knew that we would eventually see him one day on the news, wearing an orange jumpsuit being charged with murder."
When the news broke that a gunman had terrorized Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, <n>Guarino</n> said she knew it was <n>Cruz</n>, her former neighbor, a boy she saw grow up alongside her own children.
<n>Guarino</n> said her home was the house in the suburban neighborhood where all the kids on the street hung out, including <n>Cruz</n>. They played on her large grassy lawn and swam in the backyard pool.
<n>Cruz</n>, she said, never looked her in the eyes. Another neighbor described <n>Cruz</n> the same way: He liked wearing a hoodie and walked looking down, never speaking much.
"He was dealing with something dark," a neighbor who would only speak anonymously said. "I just didn't know what."
