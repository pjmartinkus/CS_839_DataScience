South Africa and Wales' rugby sides will play a one-off test match at the RFK Stadium in Washington DC, it was announced Monday.
The two nations will meet on June 2 at the 46,000-seater stadium, which was previously home to the Washington Redskins and, until last year, Major League Soccer team DC United.
"The match in Washington allows us to take Springbok rugby to America and potentially expand the team's appeal to a very large audience," says <n>Jurie Roux</n>, head of the South Africa Rugby Union.
"Our research shows that the Springboks have a growing worldwide fan base and we see the match in Washington as an ideal platform to tap into a market that offers huge possibilities for South African rugby, in the exciting American sporting area."
The seven-a-side game has proved particularly popular in the US. The Las Vegas leg of the Sevens World Series has, in recent seasons, attracted over 80,000 spectators across three days of competition.
Sevens will get a further boost when San Francisco plays host to this year's World Cup in July.
