The Comcast CEO just announced a $31 billion bid for the British broadcaster Sky, directly challenging two of his fellow media moguls, <n>Rupert Murdoch</n> and <n>Bob Iger</n>.
The move comes just a few months after <n>Murdoch</n> spurned <n>Roberts</n>' offer to buy most of 21st Century Fox. A Comcast-Fox combination was intriguing. But <n>Murdoch</n> struck a deal with Disney's <n>Iger</n> instead.
Now <n>Roberts</n> is back with an offer for Sky that can't be ignored.
Comcast, of course, says this isn't personal at all. The company is telling investors that the deal will "extend Comcast's international footprint" and fuel "growth investments."
And all of that makes sense on paper. But think about the players here. These men, who have known each other for decades, are vying for global growth opportunities. Some billionaire-size egos are involved.
These media CEOs are in a constant state of competition, as measured by market cap, network ratings, number of vacation homes and other metrics.
And <n>Roberts</n>' all-cash offer for Sky complicates both <n>Murdoch</n>'s pending takeover of Sky and <n>Iger</n>'s pursuit of the Fox assets.
Sky is attractive because it beams valuable TV programming to tens of millions of viewers in the UK, Germany, Italy and other countries.
