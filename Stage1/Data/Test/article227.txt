Two women who met decades ago both went on to become librarians at schools that have become household names because of deadly mass shootings.
<n>Yvonne Cech</n> worked at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, when a gunman killed 20 children and six adults. <n>Diana Haneski</n> became a librarian at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where a gunman killed 17 people.
When the school shooting began in Parkland, Florida, <n>Haneski</n> immediately thought of all the things her friend <n>Cech</n> had told her over the years.
In an interview with CNN's <n>Anderson Cooper</n> on "AC360," <n>Haneski</n> said <n>Cech</n> had told her she needed to "make sure you have your keys on your person, your phone, your walkie-talkie. Those things were very important."
"I was trying to be ready, but I didn't think it would be getting ready for this," <n>Haneski</n> said.
<n>Cech</n> told <n>Cooper</n> that she was in "absolute disbelief" over the Parkland school shooting.
