The murders of 17 people at Stoneman Douglas High School 13 days ago was the latest in a long line of school shootings that began nearly 20 years ago at Columbine High School in Colorado. But, unlike almost all of the mass casualty shootings that have followed in those last two decades, the students of Stoneman Douglas were speaking out about what happened in their school. They were demanding politicians act -- and not taking "no" for an answer.
Then Congress came back to Washington on Monday. And man oh man, did it look like the same old script on gun legislation.
The House quickly made clear that they had already passed legislation to strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) late last year and that the ball was, therefore, in the Senate's court. (The "Fix NICS," um, fix in the House was paired with a measure supported by gun rights advocates that would allow people with concealed carry permits in one state to keep their guns concealed when they cross state lines.)
"We think the Senate can take our whole bill (up) but if the Senate cannot, we will cross that bridge when we get to it," said Speaker <n>Paul Ryan</n> of potential gun legislation in a news conference on Tuesday.
Republican leaders -- led by Majority Whip <n>John Cornyn</n> of Texas -- tried to rally unanimous consent behind the Senate version of the Fix NICS bill, which <n>Cornyn</n> and Sen. <n>Chris Murphy</n>, D-Connecticut, had introduced following the shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in 2017. That would have allowed a simple voice vote for passage.
