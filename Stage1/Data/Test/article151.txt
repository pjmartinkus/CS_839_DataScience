President <n>Donald Trump</n>'s communications directors don't stick around very long.

Using a dataset first put together by CNN's <n>Ryan Struyk</n> and adding in <n>Hick</n>'s time in the job, it's clear that <n>Trump</n>'s communication directors are setting the record for shortest average stint since the post was created during President <n>Richard Nixon</n>'s administration.
A communications director for <n>Trump</n>'s administration on average lasts less than 100 days on the job. Communications directors in the average administration, including <n>Trump</n>'s, last about 580 days or so.
