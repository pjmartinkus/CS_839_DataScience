An amendment to a Florida bill that would have banned weapons like the one used in the Parkland school shooting failed Monday amid growing cries for accountability and reform after the February 14 massacre.
Hundreds of Floridians converged on the state Capitol in Tallahassee on Monday as lawmakers took up a series of proposals after the deadly shooting.
One bill included an amendment that would ban assault-style rifles like the one used by the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooter. Senate Bill 7022, which lets law enforcement seize firearms from people under certain conditions, advanced without the amendment.
Demonstrators in orange shirts signifying gun safety chanted "shame" and "vote them out" in response to the vote.

Lawmakers have called for a state investigation of the Broward County Sheriff's Office response to the shooting. Broward County Sheriff <n>Scott Israel</n> said his department "will fully cooperate" with the probe, "as we believe in full transparency and accountability."
House Speaker <n>Richard Corcoran</n>, along with 73 other Republican state representatives, called on the governor to suspend Israel for "incompetence and neglect of duty" in a letter sent Sunday.
They said he and his deputies had information about the shooter, yet failed to intervene "in the years, months and days leading up to that shooting."
"Sheriff <n>Israel</n> failed to maintain a culture of alertness, vigilance and thoroughness amongst his deputies," the letter said. "As a result of Sheriff <n>Israel</n>'s failures, students and teachers died."
