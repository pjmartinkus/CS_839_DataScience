Panamanian authorities with helmets and guns entered a Trump-branded hotel in Panama City Wednesday morning, marking another escalation in a hostile, nearly week-long showdown between President <n>Trump</n>'s business and a local partner.
At the same time, Panama's Labor Minister told CNN that officials from his department were checking on a complaint from some hotel staffers who claim they aren't getting paid.
Labor Minister <n>Luis Ernesto Carles</n> said his agency didn't have armed officials at the hotel but cited the possibility that other government agencies were inside the luxury property.
CNN has not been able to confirm who the armed officials worked for, but a Labor Ministry spokeswoman says the armed personnel were on site at the hotel for a few hours and left in the afternoon.
As for the labor investigation, it comes days after the hotel's majority owner warned employees their jobs were at risk if they didn't listen to him. Miami-based investor <n>Orestes Fintiklis</n> and the <n>Trump</n> Organization have been locked in a legal dispute since late last year, when <n>Fintiklis</n> moved to break ties with the President's company.
The matter was supposed to be resolved through international arbitration but has since erupted into a physical standoff. In a statement Monday, the President's company claimed <n>Fintiklis</n> is using "thug-like" tactics.
