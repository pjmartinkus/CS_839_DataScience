Don't look now, but here comes the post-millennial generation.
Americans are just growing accustomed to the impact of the massive millennial generation as consumers, workers and voters. But now the crusade for gun control led by survivors of the Parkland, Florida, school shooting is heralding the arrival of the younger generation rising behind them. And in their racial diversity, attitudes toward religion and culture, their digital fluency and their political priorities, this emerging generation -- usually called the post-millennials, sometimes labeled Generation Z -- might shake American life even more profoundly than the millennials.
"The millennial generation is just the cutting edge, the front line of what this country is going to be becoming," says <n>William Frey</n>, a demographer at the Brookings Institution who has extensively studied the millennial and post-millennial generations. "The millennials are the tip of the iceberg, but rushing through for the next several decades with the post-millennials is going to be much more diversity and a very different America than we've known in the past. I think this is a big sea change for our country."
For Republicans who have nervously watched polls showing an enormous backlash against President <n>Donald Trump</n>'s insular nationalism among the millennials, this younger generation could represent an even greater threat. By 2024 -- just two presidential elections from now -- the generation of young people that includes the students organizing a march on Washington next month to demand gun control will represent 1 in every 10 eligible voters.
"It's difficult to see how the GOP will gain ground among younger adults as this newest cohort continues its demographic and cultural drift away from the average GOP voter," says <n>Daniel Cox</n>, research director of the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute, which recently conducted one of the most extensive surveys of attitudes among post-millennials in partnership with MTV. "The cultural disconnect is only going to grow. The average GOP voter is a middle-aged white Christian. That's simply not what the US is going to look like in the future."
