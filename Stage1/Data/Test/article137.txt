The father of a student who was killed in the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School said parents who don't like President <n>Donald Trump</n>'s controversial suggestion that armed teachers could combat school shooters are free to send their kids to other schools.
"You have the choice to go to any school you want, so my answer to them is, 'If you don't want a teacher or a marshal or you don't want someone with a gun at your school, you go to a gun-free school zone. That's where you go,'" said <n>Andrew Pollack</n>, who attended the meeting last week at which <n>Trump</n> suggested arming teachers.
Leaving to parents whether to send their children to schools with armed teachers or a police presence "fixes everything," said <n>Pollack</n>, who spoke Wednesday with anchor <n>Alisyn Camerota</n> on CNN's "New Day."
"This is America, and it's freedom of choice, right?" said <n>Pollack</n>, whose daughter, <n>Meadow</n>, died in the Parkland, Florida massacre.
"This is my life," <n>Pollack</n> said, "and I just want to be the last one. It stops with me."
<n>Pollack</n> also revealed that he hears <n>Meadow</n>'s voice in his head, calling him "Daddy" and empowering him to "work nonstop" to combat school shootings, he said.
