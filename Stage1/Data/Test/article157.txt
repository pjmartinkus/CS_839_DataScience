Nobody knew quite what to think.
After a wide-ranging, televised meeting Wednesday at the White House, Democrats walked away stunned and with some tepid optimism that something substantial could happen on guns, while Republicans appeared flummoxed.
After all, President <n>Donald Trump</n> had defied traditional GOP orthodoxy on an issue as essential to the Republican brand as any: guns.
And unlike earlier meetings where <n>Trump</n> has embraced bipartisanship without any specificity, <n>Trump</n> was explicit about what he wanted Wednesday. On camera, he'd pushed to raise the age at which an individual can purchase a rifle from 18 to 21 even after a weekend lunch with officials from the National Rifle Association, who have publicly opposed the change. <n>Trump</n> called to expand background checks and told the House's Majority Whip <n>Steve Scalise</n> that a concealed carry bill would never pass attached to legislation to incentivize states to enter data into the national background checks database.
