The strange collective reality show the country continues to live in during the <n>Trump</n> administration took an unexpected and odd turn Tuesday.
The Indiana-born federal judge who President <n>Donald Trump</n> once said could not be impartial because he was "Mexican" cleared a major obstacle standing in the way of <n>Trump</n>'s long-promised border wall with Mexico. Read more about his 100-page order Tuesday that the current administration, like administrations before it, can waive environmental laws.
The judge, <n>Gonzalo Curiel</n>, first entered the <n>Trump</n> political story long before the President came to the White House, back when <n>Curiel</n> got a class-action lawsuit concerning students who said they had been defrauded by <n>Trump</n> University. The case was ultimately settled after <n>Trump</n> won the White House.
<n>Trump</n> said <n>Curiel</n> was not going to be impartial because he was "Mexican." <n>Curiel</n> works in the Southern District of California but was born in Indiana.
<n>Trump</n>'s attacks on <n>Curiel</n> weren't a one-off thing, either. They were repeated and sustained and mean. "I have a judge who is a hater of <n>Donald Trump</n>, a hater. He's a hater," <n>Trump</n> said in San Diego in May of 2016, kicking off the controversy.
