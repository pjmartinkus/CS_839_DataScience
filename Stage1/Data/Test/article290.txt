A week after one of the deadliest mass shootings in modern US history, Florida Gov. <n>Rick Scott</n> announced a comprehensive plan to keep students safe in his state, including suggestions to raise the minimum age to buy a gun, keep weapons out of the hands of the mentally ill and ban the sale of bump stocks.
A former student fatally shot 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland on February 14, sparking renewed and heated debate over the middle point between Second Amendment rights and student safety.
"We must take care of our kids," <n>Scott</n>, a Republican, said at a news conference announcing his three-part plan.
<n>Kai Koerber</n>, a student at Stoneman Douglas who was there the day of the shooting, called the plan "a step in the right direction."
