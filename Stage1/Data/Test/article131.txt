An Alaskan congressman has suggested that more Jews would have survived the Holocaust if they had been armed with guns.
Rep. <n>Don Young</n> made the statement during an appearance last week before the Alaska Municipal League and while answering a question about what can be done to prevent gun violence in schools.
<n>Young</n>, a Republican, argued that arming teachers would help keep students safe, then ticked off examples of what he says happens when governments take firearms away from citizens.
"How many millions of people were shot and killed because they were unarmed? Fifty million in Russia because their citizens weren't armed," <n>Young</n> said. "How many Jews were put in the ovens because they were unarmed?"
The audience made no visible or audible reaction to <n>Young</n>'s remarks, according to a video of his remarks posted to YouTube.
The video is posted on the YouTube page of <n>Dimitri Shein</n>, a Democratic candidate for Congress who is running against Young. <n>Shein</n> is also the man seen in the video questioning <n>Young</n>.
<n>Shein</n> posted the video to Twitter on Sunday and tagged several members of the media, including anchors at CNN.
<n>Murphy McCollough</n>, <n>Young</n>'s press secretary, said in a statement to CNN that the congressman's comment at the event "has been taken entirely out of context."
"He was referencing the fact that when <n>Hitler</n> confiscated firearms from Jewish Germans, those communities were less able to defend themselves," <n>McCollough</n> said. "He was not implying that an armed Jewish population would have been able to prevent the horrors of the Holocaust, but his intended message is that disarming citizens can have detrimental consequences. A defenseless people are left up to the mercy of its leaders."
