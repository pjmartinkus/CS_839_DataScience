Republican leaders in both chambers of Congress appear very wary of entering into a gun debate.
The House finishes work for the week this afternoon. The Senate GOP's fast track effort to move a narrow, but bipartisan background check compliance bill was blocked Monday night, and the balance of the chamber's week is scheduled to be spent on nomination votes.
Senate lawmakers in both parties are all over the map on what they want (or don't want) to do.
If the first day back on Capitol Hill for lawmakers since the Parkland shooting was any indication, this time is not, in fact, different when it comes to the gun debate -- at least so far.
Sen. <n>Chuck Schumer</n> said on Monday passing only the Fix NICS background checks bill -- a bill <n>Schumer</n> co-sponsors -- an "abject failure and dereliction of duty."
Republicans, to the extent there is a desire to move something, want narrow and limited.
Or, as Sen. <n>John Cornyn</n>, the co-author of the Fix NICS bill, put it: "I'm for doing what's achievable."
What doesn't clearly exist at the moment is some kind of clear middle ground beyond the Fix NICS bill that was blocked (but has the support to pass the Senate) Monday night.
