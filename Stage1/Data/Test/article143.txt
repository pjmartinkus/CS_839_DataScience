Support for continuing the DACA program remains high and bipartisan, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS, and about six in 10 Americans say it is likely that it will wind up continuing.
The poll, conducted before the Supreme Court declined Monday to immediately consider a case on the program, found that those who back continuing the program hold President <n>Donald Trump</n> and the Republicans in Congress (31%) responsible for it not yet having been extended more than they do the Democrats in Congress (17%).
A broad majority, 83%, favor continuing the Obama-era program, while 12% say it should be ended. Those figures have held roughly steady in CNN polling back to mid-September. The program has support from 94% of Democrats, 83% of independents and 67% of Republicans.
Overall, 61% say it's very or somewhat likely that the program will ultimately be continued. Republicans are more inclined to think the program will live on than are Democrats: 71% of Republicans say it's very or somewhat likely to continue, compared with 66% of independents and just 51% of Democrats.
<n>Trump</n> moved to end the program in early September, setting up a March 5 target date on which the program would begin phasing out, while urging Congress to take action on the program. Although Congress has thus far failed to advance any legislation and has been at odds with the White House, federal court rulings have allowed the program to continue, and by not taking up the case, the Supreme Court allows those rulings to stand until they do address the issue, rendering the March 5 date null.
