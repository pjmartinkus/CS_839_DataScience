Russians tracking the activities of <n>Prigozhin</n> say they see a pattern of harassment and intimidation.
<n>Yevgeny Shabaev</n>, who has spoken in Russian-language media on behalf of mercenaries wounded in the attack and who says he has visited some of the wounded, said he had received a message warning him against publicizing <n>Wagner</n> casualties. The message appeared to be linked to a fake social-media account that had no photos.
"He will fight like a trapped beast, if necessary," the message, seen by CNN, to <n>Shabaev</n> read. "A couple of weeks ago, this beast had suffered major losses, but this just makes him angrier, and his group of professional annihilators didn't go anywhere. So decide for yourself if itÂ¹s worth teasing this beast even more."
