President <n>Donald Trump</n> is the unquestioned king of this year's Conservative Political Action Conference. But with his throne on the line in 2020, the faithful here are already busy handicapping the Democratic field.
According to a very unofficial straw poll conducted Thursday and Friday morning, Sen. <n>Elizabeth Warren</n> of Massachusetts emerged as the potential challenger CPAC "voters" believe <n>Trump</n> would most assuredly outlast.
The question, posed to 75 respondees, was this: "Which Democrat considering a run in 2020 do you think <n>Trump</n> would be most likely to defeat?"
Twenty-two of them, so about 30%, chose <n>Warren</n>.
For many, the reasoning was twofold. A number of â€œ<n>Warren</n> voters" said they thought she simply matched up poorly with <n>Trump</n>. Coleman Theodore, a student from the College of Charleston, called her "a <n>Donald Trump</n> to the left," and expected she would falter in a barbed campaign fight.
