<n>Wilford</n> came under the care of Dr. <n>Igor Nichiporenko</n>, medical director of trauma services at the hospital.
When she arrived, she was "pale and not responsive. She was in shock," said <n>Nichiporenko</n>, who also spoke at the news conference. He had little information but could see that she had "multiple gunshot wounds" to her chest, abdomen and upper sternum.
<n>Nichiporenko</n> had to perform "damage control," amounting to extricating bullets and repairing damage, first in <n>Wilford</n>'s abdomen and then her chest and in the right upper extremity, where tendons had been "shattered from gunshot wounds."
Despite her horrendous injuries, <n>Wilford</n> has made an almost miraculous recovery.
"Her hospital stay was less than seven days," <n>Nichiporenko</n> said. "Young people have a tendency to heal very fast. She's very, very lucky."
Asked whether <n>Ojeda</n>'s call to take her to Broward Health North instead of the more distant hospital saved <n>Wilford</n>'s life, <n>Nichiporenko</n> said, simply, "yes, of course."
