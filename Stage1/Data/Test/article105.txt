<n>Jared Kushner</n>, who has worn dueling hats for more than a year as President <n>Donald Trump</n>'s senior adviser and son-in-law, has been stripped of his access to the nation's top secrets, officials said Tuesday after his security clearance was downgraded.
<n>Kushner</n>, along with other White House officials who had been operating on interim clearances, had their access altered last week after chief of staff <n>John Kelly</n> stipulated new changes to the security clearance system.
Aides who previously operated on "top secret/sensitive compartmented information" interim clearances saw their access changed to "secret," a classification for less sensitive material. The lesser "secret" clearance allows access to far fewer government secrets. It would prevent <n>Kushner</n> from accessing the Presidential Daily Brief, the collection of top secret material prepared for the commander in chief every day.
Dozens of White House officials have operated on interim clearances since <n>Trump</n> took office more than a year ago. <n>Kelly</n> had grown frustrated with the high number of aides without permanent access and has worked to shrink the number of temporary clearances. He issued a memo last week spelling out changes to the system, which gained new scrutiny after domestic abuse allegations against former aide <n>Rob Porter</n> surfaced this month.
In the February 16 memo, <n>Kelly</n> stated that White House officials who have been operating on interim clearances since last June would have their temporary clearances discontinued. That included <n>Kushner</n>, who has taken on a wide portfolio as senior adviser, including sensitive foreign policy matters. Asked on Friday whether he would grant Kushner an exemption from the new mandate, <n>Trump</n> said it would be <n>Kelly</n>'s decision.
