# Stage 4 Code

### Files:

The matching_workflow.py file contains the code we used to match the Walmart and Amazon tables. It is essentially the workflow developed in Stage 3 put into a single python function that can be run to match the two tables.

The Features.py file contains the code for the block box features we used in both the blocking and matching stages. This file also contains new features used in the Brand Classification analysis we run in this stage.

The mergin.py file contains the code to actually merge the Walmart and Amazon tables with the matches we obtain with the matching workflow.

### Jupyter Notebooks:

The Merging Table notebook shows how we matched and merged the Walmart and Amazon tables.

The Analysis and Classification notebook shows our OLAP and Classification Analysis.
