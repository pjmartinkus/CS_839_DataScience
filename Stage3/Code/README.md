# Stage 3 Code

### Files:

The Cleaning.py file contains the code we used to clean our tables. More information about what we did to clean can be found in the README.me file in the Data directory. This file contains all of the code required to clean the data tables and an example of how to use it can be found in our Jupyter Notebook.

The Features.py file contains the code for the block box features we used in both the blocking and matching stages. In the blocking stage we developed a feature to compare the Screen Size, RAM, and Hard Drive Capacities of the laptops and in the matching stage we developed a feature to check if both laptops are refurbished.

The actual files contain explanations of all of the functions used.

### Jupyter Notebook:

The Jupyter Notebook explains the entire end to end pipeline we used to develope a matcher for our data. The notebook shows step by step how we cleaned the data, blocked the tables, generated features, selected a matcher, and evaluated the matchers. The Jupyter notebook is saved in the Entity Matching.ipynb file.
